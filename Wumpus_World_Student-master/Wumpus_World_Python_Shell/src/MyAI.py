# DESCRIPTION: This file contains your agent class, which you will
#              implement. You are responsible for implementing the
#              'getAction' function and any helper methods you feel you
#              need.
#
# NOTES:       - If you are having trouble understanding how the shell
#                works, look at the other parts of the code, as well as
#                the documentation.
#
#              - You are only allowed to make changes to this portion of
#                the code. Any changes to other portions of the code will
#                be lost when the tournament runs your code.
